Working through Algorithms Illuminated Part 1: The Basics by Tim Roughgarden using Ruby

## Testing
I ran these just with irb. No spec, I know that wasn't good, but this is me attempting to learn the material.
`irb -r ./merge_and_count_sort.rb`
```
irb(main):001:0> MergeAndCountSort.do_it_from_book([1,2],[4,5])
=> [[1, 2, 4, 5], 3]
```
